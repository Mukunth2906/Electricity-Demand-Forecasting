## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **📥 Data Collection** – Sourced from authentic, natural datasets relevant to Delhi.  
2. **🔍 Data Exploration** – Identifying key attributes, correlations, and visual patterns.  
3. **🧼 Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, encoding, and normalizing the data.  
4. **🧠 Model Building** – Applying classification/regression models using Scikit-learn.  
5. **📊 Evaluation** – Accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics for model performance.  
6. **📈 Interpretation** – Translating predictions into meaningful recommendations.
